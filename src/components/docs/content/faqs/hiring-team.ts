## "When should I make my first hire?"

Knowing the right time to hire is critical. Here’s how you can tell if it’s time to expand your team in Canada:

### Hiring Triggers

1. **Capacity Indicators:**  
   - **Turning Down Work:** If you’re missing out on projects because you simply don’t have the bandwidth—perhaps turning away orders in your Ontario-based business—it’s time to bring on extra help.
   - **Quality Suffering:** When your work quality starts to slip because you’re overextended, consider hiring to maintain high standards.
   - **Growth Limitations:** If your business is ready to grow but you’re stuck doing everything yourself, hiring can unlock more opportunities in the competitive Canadian market.
   - **Personal Burnout:** Feeling overwhelmed and exhausted from managing every task is a clear signal that it's time for additional support.

2. **Financial Readiness:**  
   - **Stable Cash Flow:** Ensure you have consistent revenue in Canadian dollars to comfortably support a new salary.
   - **6+ Months Runway:** Have enough funds to cover a new hire’s salary and benefits for at least six months.
   - **Predictable Revenue:** A steady income stream makes it safer to add payroll costs.
   - **ROI Calculation:** Estimate how much additional revenue the hire could generate compared to their cost.

3. **Role Clarity:**  
   - **Clear Job Description:** Define exactly what tasks the new hire will perform.
   - **Defined Outcomes:** Know what success looks like for the role.
   - **Performance Metrics:** Decide how you’ll measure their effectiveness.
   - **Integration Plan:** Prepare a thorough onboarding and training process to help them adapt to your company culture.

### Decision Framework
1. **Cost vs. Benefit:** Calculate if the potential extra revenue justifies the expense of hiring in the Canadian labour market.
2. **Identify Critical Needs:** Pinpoint tasks that you cannot manage effectively on your own.
3. **Consider Alternatives:** Temporary help or outsourcing (using local platforms like Workopolis or Indeed Canada) might suffice initially.
4. **Plan the Onboarding Process:** Prepare detailed training materials and support systems.
5. **Establish a Timeline:** Determine when your workload demands extra hands and plan your hiring schedule accordingly.

## "Should I hire employees or contractors?"

Deciding between hiring full-time employees or contractors depends on your business needs and budget, with some considerations unique to the Canadian context:

### Comparison

| **Factor**     | **Employees**                                 | **Contractors**                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Control**    | High – Direct oversight of daily tasks        | Limited – They work independently               |
| **Cost**       | Higher – Includes benefits, CPP, EI, and taxes  | Variable – Pay per project or task; fewer overheads |
| **Commitment** | Long-term investment in company culture       | Project-based, short-term engagement            |
| **Compliance** | Subject to Canadian employment laws           | Fewer regulatory obligations                    |
| **Culture**    | Directly contribute to and shape company culture | Less influence on your core team culture       |

### Decision Factors
1. **Work Nature:**  
   - For ongoing, core business functions, hiring employees is often the best option.
   - For one-off projects or specialized tasks, contractors can offer the flexibility needed.
2. **Budget Constraints:**  
   - Full-time employees come with higher fixed costs, including benefits mandated in Canada.
   - Contractors offer flexibility, which can be advantageous when funds are tight.
3. **Growth Stage:**  
   - Early-stage businesses may lean towards contractors to remain lean.
   - As you scale, building a dedicated in-house team might be essential.
4. **Skill Specialization:**  
   - For niche or highly technical tasks, contractors might be the right choice.
5. **Management Capacity:**  
   - Employees require more oversight and cultural integration, so consider whether you have the management bandwidth.
