### Gross Margins
Gross margin measures the percentage of revenue remaining after covering the cost of goods sold (COGS). It is a key indicator of pricing effectiveness and production efficiency.

| Category          | Average   | Top Performers |
|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Luxury**        | 60-65%    | >70%          |

| **Discount**      | 30-35%    | >40%          |

*Example:* A luxury retailer achieving a 70% gross margin outperforms industry averages, indicating high pricing power and controlled costs.

### Operating Margins
Operating margin reflects the percentage of revenue left after all operating expenses are deducted, showcasing overall business efficiency.

| Type            | Average   | Top Performers |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **High-end**    | 12-15%   | >18%          |

|----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Sales per Sq Ft**  | \$300-400    | \$200-800   |

### Store Operations
Effective cost management is essential to maintain profitability in a retail environment.
