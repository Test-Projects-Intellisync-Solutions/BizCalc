## Financial Metrics

### Billing Rates
Benchmark billing rates vary by role and expertise. Below are typical ranges:

| Role       | Junior      | Mid-Level    | Senior       |
|------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Strategy**   | \$150-200  | \$250-350   | \$400-600+   |
| **Technical**  | \$125-175  | \$200-300   | \$350-500    |
| **Creative**   | \$100-150  | \$175-250   | \$300-450    |
| **Management** | \$175-225  | \$275-375   | \$450-700+   |

*Example:* A mid-level technical consultant typically charges between \$200 and \$300 per hour.

### Utilization Rates
Utilization rates indicate how much of an employeeâ€™s time is billable:

| Role Type  | Target        | Top Performers |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Billable**   | 75-85%       | >85%          |
| **Mixed**      | 60-70%       | >70%          |
| **Management** | 40-50%       | >50%          |

*Example:* If a consultant is available for 160 hours in a month, achieving a 75% utilization rate means 120 hours are billable.

## Project Metrics

### Project Margins
Project margins vary by project type. Common benchmarks include:

| Type            | Average    | Top Performers |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| **Fixed Price**     | 30-40%    | >45%          |
| **Time & Materials**| 40-50%    | >55%          |
| **Retainer**        | 45-55%    | >60%          |

*Example:* A fixed-price project earning \$100,000 with a margin of 35% generates \$35,000 in profit.

### Average Project Size
Project size benchmarks vary by agency size:

| Agency Size | Average    | Top Performers |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **Small**       | \$25K      | >\$40K         |
| **Mid-Size**    | \$75K      | >\$100K        |
| **Large**       | \$150K+    | >\$250K        |

*Example:* A mid-size agency typically handles projects worth around \$75,000, with top performers exceeding \$100,000 per project.

## Operational Metrics

### Revenue Per Employee
This metric measures productivity and efficiency:

| Specialization | Average    | Top Performers |
|----------------|------------|----------------|
| **Strategy**   | \$200K     | >\$300K       |
| **Digital**    | \$175K     | >\$250K       |
| **Creative**   | \$150K     | >\$225K       |
| **Technical**  | \$185K     | >\$275K       |

*Example:* If a digital agency with 10 employees generates \$1.75M in revenue, the revenue per employee is \$175K.

### Overhead Ratios
Overhead ratios help monitor non-billable expenses:

| Category        | Target    | Range       |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| **G&A**         | 15-20%    | 12-25%      |
| **Sales/Marketing** | 8-12%     | 5-15%       |
| **Technology**  | 5-8%      | 3-10%       |

*Example:* A G&A overhead ratio of 18% means that 18 cents of every revenue dollar is spent on general and administrative expenses.

## Client Metrics

### Client Retention
Retention rates indicate how well agencies maintain long-term relationships:

| Relationship    | Average   | Top Performers |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Project-Based** | 40-50%   | >60%          |
| **Retainer**      | 70-80%   | >85%          |
| **Strategic**     | 80-90%   | >90%          |

*Example:* A retainer relationship with an 80% retention rate shows that most clients continue their engagement over time.

### Sales Metrics
Tracking the conversion rates through your sales funnel is crucial:

| Stage               | Average  | Best Practice  |
|---------------------|----------|----------------|
| **Lead to Meeting** | 25%      | >35%           |
| **Meeting to Proposal** | 30%      | >40%           |
| **Proposal to Close**   | 25%      | >35%           |

*Example:* If 100 leads generate 30 meetings and eventually 8 closed deals, you can assess where improvements are needed in the funnel.
