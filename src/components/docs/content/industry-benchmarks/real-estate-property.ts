## Investment Metrics

### Cap Rates
| Property Type     | Average | Range |
|-------------------|---------|-------|
| Multifamily       | 4-6%    | 3-8%  |
| Office            | 5-7%    | 4-9%  |
| Retail            | 6-8%    | 5-10% |
| Industrial        | 5-7%    | 4-9%  |

*Example:* A multifamily property with a cap rate of 5% indicates that the net operating income (NOI) is 5% of the property's purchase price.

### ROI Metrics
| Type              | Average   | Top Performers |
|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Cash-on-Cash      | 6-8%      | >10%           |
| IRR               | 12-15%    | >18%           |
| Equity Multiple   | 1.8-2.2x  | >2.5x          |

*Example:* A property achieving a cash-on-cash return of 7% means that for every \$100 invested, \$7 is returned annually in cash.

## Property Management

### Occupancy Rates
| Property Type  | Target  | Range   |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| Residential    | >95%    | 90-98%  |
| Office         | >90%    | 85-95%  |
| Retail         | >92%    | 88-96%  |
| Industrial     | >95%    | 90-98%  |

*Example:* A residential property with a 96% occupancy rate is performing well, indicating minimal vacancies.

### Operating Costs
| Category      | % of Revenue | Range   |
|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Maintenance   | 8-12%        | 6-15%   |
| Administration| 5-8%         | 4-10%   |
| Marketing     | 3-5%         | 2-7%    |
| Insurance     | 2-4%         | 1-6%    |

*Example:* Keeping maintenance costs within 8-12% of revenue can help maintain a healthy operating margin.

## Financial Performance

### NOI Margins
| Property Type  | Average   | Top Performers |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| Residential    | 55-65%    | >70%          |
| Office         | 60-70%    | >75%          |
| Retail         | 65-75%    | >80%          |
| Industrial     | 70-80%    | >85%          |

*Example:* A retail property with an NOI margin of 70% suggests efficient management and strong revenue generation relative to operating expenses.

### Expense Ratios
| Type             | Target   | Range    |
|------------------|----------|----------|
| Operating Expense Ratio | 35-45%  | 30-50%  |
| Fixed Expenses   | 25-30%   | 20-35%   |
| Variable Costs   | 10-15%   | 8-20%    |

*Example:* Maintaining an operating expense ratio of 40% means that 40 cents of every revenue dollar goes towards operating costs, which should be optimized for maximum profitability.

## Leasing Metrics

### Tenant Metrics
| Metric         | Target   | Range   |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| Retention Rate | >70%     | 60-85%  |
| Lease Renewal  | >75%     | 65-90%  |
| Collection Rate| >98%     | 95-99%  |

*Example:* A collection rate of 99% shows that nearly all rent is collected on time, reflecting strong tenant reliability.

### Lease Terms
| Type         | Average       | Range        |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Residential  | 12 months     | 6-24 months  |
| Office       | 5-7 years     | 3-10 years   |
| Retail       | 5-10 years    | 3-15 years   |
| Industrial   | 3-5 years     | 2-10 years   |

*Example:* In a secondary market, property values might appreciate at an average rate of 5% annually.

### Market Metrics

|---------------------|----------|----------|
| Absorption Rate     | >90%     | 80-100%  |
| Days on Market      | <45 days | 30-90 days|
| Price/Sq Ft Growth  | 2-4%     | 1-8%     |

*Example:* A low days-on-market metric (e.g., 35 days) indicates high demand for properties in that area.
