## Revenue Metrics

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
MRR is the predictable, recurring revenue generated by your subscription-based business each month.
| Stage      | Median | Top Quartile |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| Seed       | \$25K | \$50K       |
| Series A   | \$150K | \$300K      |
| Series B   | \$800K | \$1.5M      |

*Example:* A Seed-stage SaaS company might have an MRR of \$30K, while a successful Series A company could target around \$200K.

### Annual Growth Rate
This metric indicates how quickly your revenue is growing year-over-year.
| Stage      | Median | Top Quartile |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| Seed       | 15%    | 25%          |
| Series A   | 100%   | 150%         |
| Series B   | 70%    | 100%         |

*Example:* A Series A company might double its revenue annually, achieving around 100% growth.

## Customer Metrics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
CAC measures the total cost of acquiring a new customer, including all marketing and sales expenses.
| Channel      | Median   | Range         |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| Direct       | \$1,000  | \$500-2,000   |
| Enterprise   | \$5,000  | \$2,000-10,000|

*Example:* If a SaaS business spends \$50,000 on marketing and sales in a month and acquires 50 new customers, the CAC would be \$1,000.

### Lifetime Value (LTV)
LTV is the total revenue expected from a customer over the entire duration of their relationship with your business.
| Segment     | Median  | Top Quartile  |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| SMB         | \$3,000 | >\$5,000     |
| Mid-Market  | \$15,000| >\$25,000    |
| Enterprise  | \$50,000| >\$100,000   |

*Example:* An enterprise client with an LTV of \$75,000 is more valuable than an SMB client with an LTV of \$4,000.

## Financial Metrics

### Gross Margins
Gross margin is the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS).
- **Industry Average:** 70-85%
- **Top Performers:** >80%
- **Services Heavy:** 60-70%

*Example:* A SaaS company with a gross margin of 80% retains \$0.80 for every dollar of revenue before operating expenses.

### Operating Expenses (as % of Revenue)
Breakdown by key expense categories:
- **R&D:** 15-25%
- **Sales & Marketing:** 40-60%
- **General & Administrative (G&A):** 15-20%

### Cash Flow Metrics
- **Burn Multiple:** 1.0-1.5 (lower is better)
- **CAC Payback Period:** 12-18 months
- **Rule of 40:** Combined growth rate and profit margin should be >40%

*Example:* A SaaS business with a burn multiple of 1.2 and a CAC payback period of 14 months is considered efficient in managing its cash and growth.

---

## Efficiency Metrics

### Sales Efficiency
- **Magic Number:** >1.0 indicates that each dollar spent on sales generates more than one dollar in revenue.
- **Sales Cycle:** Typically 30-90 days from lead to close.
- **Win Rate:** 20-30% conversion from proposals to closed deals.

### Customer Success
- **Churn Rate:** Ideally <2% monthly.
- **NPS Score:** A Net Promoter Score above 40 signals strong customer loyalty.
- **CSAT Score:** A Customer Satisfaction score above 90% is excellent.

*Example:* A churn rate of 1.5% monthly means that out of 100 customers, fewer than 2 leave each month.

## Operational Benchmarks

### Team Size
| Stage     | Median | Range      |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Seed      | 10     | 5-15       |
| Series A  | 30     | 20-50      |
| Series B  | 100    | 75-150     |

*Example:* A Series A company might have around 30 employees, ensuring enough capacity to manage growth.

### Revenue Per Employee
| Stage    | Median   | Top Quartile  |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Early    | \$100K   | \$150K       |
| Growth   | \$150K   | \$200K       |
| Scale    | \$200K   | \$250K       |

*Example:* Generating \$150K per employee indicates efficient resource utilization.

- **Gross Margins <65%:** May signal high costs or poor pricing.
- **Churn >3% Monthly:** High churn undermines growth.
- **Burn Multiple >2.0:** Suggests inefficient use of cash relative to growth.
