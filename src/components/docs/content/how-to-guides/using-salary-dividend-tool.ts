## Getting Started

### Initial Setup
1. **Enter Business Profit:**  
   Input your net profit before taxes.
2. **Input Tax Rates:**  
   Include both corporate tax rates and personal tax brackets.
3. **Set Personal Income Needs:**  
   Define the amount you require for your living expenses.
4. **Define Business Requirements:**  
   Consider how much cash the business needs to reinvest in growth and operations.

*Example:* A business owner with \$200,000 in profit, facing a personal tax bracket of 35% and a corporate tax rate of 15%, needs to decide how to split the profit between a salary and dividends.

## Using the Calculator

### 1. Data Entry
- **Business Revenue:** Enter total revenue figures.
- **Operating Expenses:** Record all business expenses to determine net profit.
- **Personal Expenses:** Include your required personal living expenses.
- **Tax Brackets:** Input relevant tax rates for both personal income and dividends.

*Example:* A business with \$200,000 in profit, personal expenses of \$80,000, and applicable tax rates can input these figures to see different outcomes.

### 2. Analysis Options
- **Pure Salary:** All income is taken as salary.
- **Pure Dividends:** All income is taken as dividends.
- **Mixed Approach:** A combination of both salary and dividends.
- **Custom Split:** Adjust the percentage of salary versus dividends to test various scenarios.

*Example:* Compare a scenario where you take 70% as salary and 30% as dividends versus one with a 50/50 split to see the impact on total tax and cash flow.

### 3. Results Review
- **Total Tax Impact:** Understand the tax liability under each scenario.
- **Take-Home Amount:** Calculate the net income after taxes.
- **Business Impact:** Assess how each scenario affects the company’s cash flow and working capital.
- **Cash Flow Effect:** Evaluate the overall financial health of both your personal and business finances.

*Example:* The tool might show that a 60/40 split (salary/dividends) results in a lower effective tax rate and leaves more cash available for reinvestment.

## Optimization Strategies

### Tax Efficiency
1. **Bracket Management:**  
   Structure your salary to minimize pushing yourself into higher tax brackets.
2. **Timing Considerations:**  
   Time dividend payments to coincide with lower personal tax periods.
3. **Deduction Planning:**  
   Utilize available deductions to reduce taxable income.
4. **Credit Utilization:**  
   Take advantage of any tax credits available for both personal and business expenses.

### Business Impact
1. **Working Capital:**  
   Ensure that your compensation structure leaves enough cash for operational needs.
2. **Growth Funding:**  
   Retain sufficient funds within the business for expansion.
3. **Debt Service:**  
   Maintain the ability to cover any debt obligations.
4. **Investment Plans:**  
   Balance personal income with reinvestment opportunities in the business.

*Example:* A company might choose a mixed approach where a portion of profits is retained as dividends for reinvestment, while the owner takes a moderate salary to meet personal needs without straining the business’s cash flow.
