## Understanding Ratios

### Liquidity Ratios
These ratios measure your business's ability to meet short-term obligations.

1. **Current Ratio**
   - **Formula Explanation:** Current Assets divided by Current Liabilities.
   - **Target Ranges:** Typically, a ratio above 2:1 is considered healthy.
   - **Industry Standards:** Can vary; for instance, retail might aim for a higher ratio than manufacturing.
   - **Warning Signs:** A ratio below 1:1 suggests liquidity issues.
   - *Example:* If a company has \$200,000 in current assets and \$100,000 in current liabilities, the current ratio is 2:1, indicating it can cover its short-term debts.

2. **Quick Ratio**
   - **Calculation Method:** (Current Assets - Inventory) divided by Current Liabilities.
   - **Interpretation:** Excludes inventory to focus on the most liquid assets.
   - **Benchmarks:** A ratio greater than 1:1 is ideal.
   - **Red Flags:** A ratio below 0.5:1 indicates serious liquidity concerns.
   - *Example:* A business with \$150,000 in current assets, \$50,000 in inventory, and \$100,000 in liabilities has a quick ratio of 1 (i.e., (150,000-50,000)/100,000).

### Profitability Ratios
These ratios indicate how well your business converts revenue into profit.

1. **Gross Margin**
   - **Revenue Impact:** Shows how much revenue remains after deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS).
   - **Cost Analysis:** Helps assess production efficiency.
   - **Industry Comparison:** Benchmarks vary; for example, tech companies may have higher margins than retail.
   - **Improvement Strategies:** Focus on reducing production costs or optimizing pricing.
   - *Example:* If revenue is \$500,000 and COGS is \$300,000, the gross margin is 40% ([500,000-300,000]/500,000).

2. **Net Margin**
   - **Bottom Line Health:** Measures overall profitability after all expenses.
   - **Efficiency Measure:** Reflects how effectively a company controls costs.
   - **Market Position:** Higher net margins indicate a strong competitive position.
   - **Growth Potential:** Consistent improvement in net margin can drive long-term success.
   - *Example:* A net margin of 15% means that after all expenses, 15 cents of every dollar earned is profit.
