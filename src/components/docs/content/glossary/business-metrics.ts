*Example:* An NPS of 40 suggests a healthy level of customer satisfaction.

### Net Retention Rate
The percentage of revenue retained from existing customers over a specific period, including expansions, contractions, and churn.
*Example:* A net retention rate of 110% means existing customers are, on average, generating 10% more revenue than before.

## O

### Operating Expense Ratio

*Example:* An operating expense ratio of 40% means 40 cents of every revenue dollar is spent on operations.

*Example:* A site with 10,000 monthly organic visitors is relying on strong SEO and content marketing.

## P

### Payback Period
The time it takes to recover the cost of an investment or, in SaaS, the time it takes to recoup the customer acquisition cost (CAC).
*Example:* If the CAC is \$100 and the average revenue per customer is \$25 per month, the payback period is 4 months.

### Profit Margin
