Welcome to Accounting Basics Cheat Sheet—a clear and concise guide to essential accounting concepts. Whether you're just starting out or need a refresher, this guide breaks down the fundamentals with plain language explanations and real-world examples.

## Basic Principles

### Double-Entry Accounting
- **Concept:** Every financial transaction affects at least two accounts.
- **Key Rule:** Debits must always equal credits.
- **Fundamental Equation:** Assets = Liabilities + Equity.
- **Real-World Example:** When you buy a computer for \$1,000 using cash, your Cash account decreases by \$1,000 (credit), while your Fixed Assets increase by \$1,000 (debit). The balance sheet stays balanced.

### Accrual vs. Cash Basis
1. **Accrual Accounting**
   - **How It Works:** Records revenue and expenses when they are earned or incurred, regardless of when the cash is received or paid.
   - **Benefits:** Provides a more accurate picture of financial performance.
   - **Example:** A consulting firm records revenue when a project is completed, even if the client pays 30 days later.
   - **Use Case:** Required for larger businesses.
2. **Cash Basis Accounting**
   - **How It Works:** Records transactions only when cash is exchanged.
   - **Benefits:** Simpler to maintain; shows immediate cash flow.
   - **Example:** A freelancer records income only when payment is received.
   - **Use Case:** Ideal for small businesses with straightforward transactions.

## Financial Statements

### Balance Sheet
- **Purpose:** Shows your business's financial position at a specific point in time.

  - **Liabilities:** What you owe.
    - *Examples:* Current liabilities (accounts payable), long-term liabilities (loans), contingent liabilities (pending lawsuits).
  - **Equity:** The owner’s interest in the business.
    - *Examples:* Paid-in capital, retained earnings.
- **Real-World Example:** A small retail store’s balance sheet might show \$50,000 in assets, \$20,000 in liabilities, and \$30,000 in equity.

### Income Statement
- **Purpose:** Provides a summary of revenues and expenses over a period, showing profit or loss.
- **Components:**
  - **Revenue:** Money earned from sales and services.
  - **Expenses:** Costs incurred to generate revenue.
    - *Examples:* Cost of goods sold, operating expenses, taxes.
- **Real-World Example:** A restaurant’s income statement might show \$100,000 in revenue, \$60,000 in expenses, resulting in a \$40,000 profit.

### Cash Flow Statement
- **Purpose:** Tracks the flow of cash in and out of your business over time.
- **Sections:**
  1. **Operating Activities:** Cash from day-to-day operations.
  2. **Investing Activities:** Cash used for buying or selling assets.

## Common Transactions

### Revenue Recognition
- **When to Record:** When the sale is made or service is rendered.
- **How Much to Record:** The full sales amount, regardless of when payment is received.
- **Accounts Affected:** Increases in revenue and corresponding assets (or accounts receivable).
- **Example:** A subscription service records revenue when a customer signs up, even if the payment is processed later.
- **Documentation Needed:** Sales invoices and contracts.

### Expense Recognition
- **Timing:** Recorded when expenses are incurred, not necessarily when paid.
- **Classification:** Expenses are categorized based on their nature (e.g., operating, non-operating).
- **Example:** A business records utility expenses in the month they are incurred, even if the bill is paid the following month.
- **Supporting Documents:** Receipts, bills, and invoices.

### Asset Purchases
- **Initial Recording:** Recorded as assets, not expenses.
- **Depreciation:** Spread the cost over the asset's useful life.
- **Maintenance vs. Capital:** Differentiate between repairs (expensed) and improvements (capitalized).
- **Disposal:** Remove the asset from the books and record any gains or losses.
- **Example:** Purchasing a company vehicle is recorded as an asset and depreciated over several years.
