An individual who invests personal capital in early-stage startups, typically in exchange for equity ownership.
*Example:* An angel investor might provide \$50,000 to a startup in exchange for 5% equity.

### Accelerator

### Burn Rate
The rate at which a company spends its cash reserves before becoming cash flow positive.

## C

### Cap Table

*Example:* A cap table might list founders owning 60%, angel investors 20%, and venture capital 20%.

### Convertible Note
A short-term debt instrument that converts to equity at a future financing round, typically used during early-stage funding.
*Example:* A startup might issue a convertible note that converts to shares during the next funding round, avoiding immediate dilution.

### Due Diligence
The thorough investigation process investors undertake to evaluate a potential investment opportunity.
*Example:* Investors may review a startup’s financials, legal documents, and market research during due diligence.

### Dilution
The reduction in ownership percentage that occurs when a company issues new shares.
*Example:* If a founder originally owns 50% of the company, issuing new shares to raise capital can reduce their percentage ownership.

## E

### Equity
Ownership interest in a company, typically represented by shares of stock.
*Example:* If you own 10,000 shares of a company, you hold a portion of its equity.

### Exit Strategy

The first time a company offers its stock for sale to the public on a securities exchange.
*Example:* A tech startup may go public via an IPO to raise significant capital for further expansion.

### IRR (Internal Rate of Return)
A metric used to estimate the profitability of potential investments, representing the annualized rate of return.
*Example:* An IRR of 20% means that the investment is expected to grow at 20% per year.

## P

### Pre-Money Valuation
The value assigned to a company before receiving external funding.
*Example:* A startup valued at \$5M before a \$1M investment has a pre-money valuation of \$5M.

### Post-Money Valuation
The value of a company after external funding has been added, calculated as Pre-Money Valuation plus Investment Amount.
*Example:* Using the previous example, the post-money valuation would be \$6M.

---

## R

### ROI (Return on Investment)
A performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment, calculated as net profit divided by the investment cost.
*Example:* If an investor gains \$200,000 on a \$100,000 investment, the ROI is 200%.

### Round (Funding)
A discrete stage of investment in a company, such as Seed, Series A, Series B, etc.
*Example:* A startup might go through a Seed round, followed by Series A and Series B as it grows.

## S

### SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)
An investment instrument that gives investors the right to receive equity in a future financing round, typically without setting a specific valuation at the time of investment.
*Example:* A startup might use a SAFE to raise \$100,000 without immediately determining its valuation.

### Seed Round
The first official stage of equity funding, typically used to develop a product and validate the business model.
*Example:* A seed round might raise \$500,000 to build a minimum viable product (MVP) and test market demand.

## T

### Term Sheet
A non-binding agreement outlining the basic terms and conditions of an investment.
*Example:* A term sheet may detail the investment amount, valuation, and investor rights before a formal agreement is drafted.

### Traction
Evidence of customer demand and product market fit, often demonstrated through user growth, revenue increases, or engagement metrics.
*Example:* A startup with rapidly growing user numbers and positive customer reviews demonstrates strong traction.

---

## V

### Venture Capital (VC)
A form of private equity financing provided to high-growth potential startups by specialized firms or funds.
*Example:* A VC firm might invest \$2M in a startup in exchange for a percentage of equity, aiming for high returns on their investment.

### Vesting
The process by which equity ownership is earned over time, rather than being granted all at once.
*Example:* A founder's shares might vest over 4 years, with a one-year cliff, meaning they earn a portion of their equity each month after the first year.
