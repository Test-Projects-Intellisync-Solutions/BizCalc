## Liquidity Ratios

### Current Ratio
- **Formula:** Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities
- **Purpose:** Measures the ability to pay short-term obligations.
- **Target:** Greater than 2:1.
- **Warning:** Below 1:1 indicates potential liquidity issues.
- *Example:* If a company has \$300,000 in current assets and \$100,000 in current liabilities, its current ratio is 3:1, which is healthy.

### Quick Ratio
- **Formula:** (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities
- **Purpose:** Measures immediate liquidity by excluding inventory.
- **Target:** Greater than 1:1.
- **Warning:** Below 0.5:1 may signal cash shortages.
- *Example:* A business with \$200,000 in current assets, \$50,000 in inventory, and \$100,000 in liabilities has a quick ratio of 1.5:1.

### Cash Ratio
- **Formula:** Cash ÷ Current Liabilities
- **Purpose:** The most conservative measure of liquidity.
- **Target:** Greater than 0.5:1.
- **Warning:** Below 0.2:1 suggests severe liquidity issues.
- *Example:* With \$40,000 in cash and \$80,000 in liabilities, the cash ratio is 0.5:1.

## Profitability Ratios

### Gross Margin
- **Formula:** (Revenue - COGS) ÷ Revenue
- **Purpose:** Measures production efficiency and pricing strategy.
- **Target:** Varies by industry; compare against industry benchmarks.
- **Warning:** Below industry average may indicate high production costs.
- *Example:* A company with \$500,000 in revenue and \$300,000 in COGS has a gross margin of 40%.

### Operating Margin
- **Formula:** Operating Income ÷ Revenue
- **Purpose:** Indicates overall operational efficiency.
- **Target:** Greater than 15%.
- **Warning:** Below 5% suggests inefficiencies in operations.
- *Example:* If operating income is \$75,000 on \$500,000 in revenue, the operating margin is 15%.

### Net Margin
- **Formula:** Net Income ÷ Revenue
- **Purpose:** Reflects overall profitability after all expenses.
- **Target:** Greater than 10%.
- **Warning:** Below 3% is a red flag for overall profitability.
- *Example:* A net income of \$50,000 on \$500,000 in revenue gives a net margin of 10%.

## Efficiency Ratios

### Asset Turnover
- **Formula:** Revenue ÷ Average Total Assets
- **Purpose:** Measures how effectively a company uses its assets to generate revenue.
- **Target:** Industry-specific.
- **Warning:** A declining trend may indicate inefficiency.
- *Example:* If revenue is \$1,000,000 and average total assets are \$500,000, the asset turnover is 2.

### Inventory Turnover
- **Formula:** COGS ÷ Average Inventory
- **Purpose:** Indicates how well inventory is managed.
- **Target:** Varies by industry.
- **Warning:** Below industry average may signal overstocking or slow sales.
- *Example:* A company with COGS of \$300,000 and average inventory of \$100,000 turns over its inventory 3 times a year.

### Receivables Turnover
- **Formula:** Net Credit Sales ÷ Average Accounts Receivable
- **Purpose:** Measures the efficiency of collecting receivables.
- **Target:** 12x or higher.
- **Warning:** Less than 8x suggests collection issues.
- *Example:* With net credit sales of \$600,000 and average accounts receivable of \$50,000, the ratio is 12x.

## Leverage Ratios

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio
- **Formula:** Total Liabilities ÷ Shareholders' Equity
- **Purpose:** Assesses financial leverage and risk.
- **Target:** Less than 2:1.
- **Warning:** Greater than 3:1 may indicate excessive debt.
- *Example:* A company with \$300,000 in liabilities and \$200,000 in equity has a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5.

### Interest Coverage
- **Formula:** EBIT ÷ Interest Expense
- **Purpose:** Evaluates a company's ability to meet its interest obligations.
- **Target:** Greater than 3:1.
- **Warning:** Below 1.5:1 is concerning.
- *Example:* If EBIT is \$90,000 and interest expense is \$30,000, the interest coverage ratio is 3:1.

## Growth Ratios

### Revenue Growth
- **Formula:** (Current Revenue - Prior Revenue) ÷ Prior Revenue
- **Purpose:** Measures the rate of increase in revenue.
- **Target:** Greater than the industry growth rate.
- **Warning:** Below inflation rates could be a red flag.
- *Example:* Revenue growing from \$500,000 to \$600,000 indicates a 20% growth rate.

### Earnings Growth
- **Formula:** (Current Earnings - Prior Earnings) ÷ Prior Earnings
- **Purpose:** Indicates improvement in profitability over time.
- **Target:** Ideally higher than revenue growth.
- **Warning:** A negative trend suggests declining profitability.
- *Example:* If earnings rise from \$50,000 to \$60,000, that’s a 20% growth rate.

## Market Ratios

### Price-to-Earnings (P/E)
- **Formula:** Stock Price ÷ Earnings per Share
- **Purpose:** Evaluates market valuation relative to earnings.
- **Target:** Industry-specific.
- **Warning:** Extreme values may indicate overvaluation or undervaluation.
- *Example:* A P/E ratio of 20 is typical for many stable companies.

### Price-to-Book (P/B)
- **Formula:** Stock Price ÷ Book Value per Share
- **Purpose:** Compares market value to the company’s net asset value.
- **Target:** Varies by industry; generally, a P/B below 1 may indicate undervaluation unless the company is distressed.
- *Example:* A P/B ratio of 1.5 means the market values the company at 1.5 times its book value.
