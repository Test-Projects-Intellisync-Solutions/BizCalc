# Financial Terms Glossary

This glossary provides clear definitions of key financial terms to help you understand the basic language of business finance. Each term is explained with straightforward language and practical examples where applicable.

## A

### Accounts Receivable (AR)
Money owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered but not yet paid for.
*Example:* A company that delivered \$10,000 worth of products but hasn’t yet received payment has \$10,000 in accounts receivable.

### Accounts Payable (AP)
Money a company owes to its suppliers or vendors for goods or services received but not yet paid for.
*Example:* If a business has purchased inventory on credit totaling \$5,000, that amount is recorded as accounts payable.

### Accrual Accounting
An accounting method that records revenue and expenses when they are incurred, regardless of when cash is exchanged.
*Example:* A service company records revenue when a project is completed, even if the client pays 30 days later.

## B

### Burn Rate
The rate at which a company spends its cash reserves on operating expenses.
*Example:* A startup spending \$50,000 a month with \$300,000 in cash reserves has a burn rate that would last approximately 6 months.

### Break-Even Point
The point at which total revenue equals total costs, resulting in neither profit nor loss.
*Example:* If fixed and variable costs total \$100,000 per month, and monthly revenue is also \$100,000, the business has reached its break-even point.

## C

### Cash Flow
The net amount of cash moving into and out of a business.
*Example:* Even if a company is profitable, delayed customer payments can result in poor cash flow.

### COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
The direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company.
*Example:* For a manufacturer, COGS includes raw materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead directly involved in production.

### Contribution Margin
The revenue remaining after subtracting variable costs, indicating how much money is available to cover fixed costs and generate profit.
*Example:* If a product sells for \$100 and its variable costs are \$60, the contribution margin is \$40 per unit.

## D

### Depreciation
The allocation of an asset's cost over its useful life.
*Example:* A machine purchased for \$10,000 might be depreciated over 5 years, with \$2,000 expense recorded annually.

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio
A measure of financial leverage calculated by dividing total liabilities by total shareholder equity.
*Example:* A company with \$200,000 in debt and \$400,000 in equity has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5.

## E

### EBITDA
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization; a measure of a company's operating performance.
*Example:* EBITDA can help compare profitability between companies by eliminating the effects of financing and accounting decisions.

### Equity
The value of ownership interest in a company, calculated as total assets minus total liabilities.
*Example:* If a company has \$1,000,000 in assets and \$600,000 in liabilities, its equity is \$400,000.

## F

### Fixed Costs
Expenses that remain constant regardless of the level of production or sales.
*Example:* Rent and salaried wages are typical fixed costs.

### Free Cash Flow
The cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain capital assets.
*Example:* Free cash flow is important for funding new projects or returning money to shareholders.

## G

### Gross Margin
The percentage of revenue remaining after subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS).
*Example:* If a company earns \$100,000 in revenue and COGS is \$40,000, the gross margin is 60%.

### Going Concern
The assumption that a business will continue to operate indefinitely.
*Example:* Financial statements are prepared under the assumption of a going concern unless there is evidence to the contrary.

## L

### Liquidity
The ease with which assets can be converted to cash.
*Example:* Cash is the most liquid asset, while real estate is less liquid.

### Leverage
The use of borrowed money to finance business operations, which can increase potential returns.
*Example:* A company might use leverage to expand operations but must manage the associated risks.

## O

### Operating Expenses
Costs associated with running the core operations of a business.
*Example:* Utilities, rent, and salaries are operating expenses.

### Operating Margin
Operating income divided by revenue, expressed as a percentage, which shows how efficiently a company manages its operations.
*Example:* A higher operating margin indicates better control over operating costs relative to revenue.

## R

### ROI (Return on Investment)
A measure of the profitability of an investment, calculated by dividing net profit by the initial investment.
*Example:* An ROI of 20% means that for every \$100 invested, \$20 is returned in profit.

### Revenue Recognition
The accounting principle dictating when revenue is recorded, typically when goods are delivered or services performed.
*Example:* A company recognizes revenue when a sale is made, even if payment is received later.

## W

### Working Capital
The difference between current assets and current liabilities, representing the funds available for daily operations.
*Example:* Positive working capital indicates that a business can cover its short-term liabilities.

### Write-off
The reduction of an asset's value to zero on the accounting records, often used when an asset is deemed uncollectible or obsolete.
*Example:* A company might write off a bad debt when it becomes clear that a customer will not pay.
