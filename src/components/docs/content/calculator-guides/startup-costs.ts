## Understanding Startup Costs

Imagine planning a big event like a wedding or a birthday party. You need to budget for a one-time venue rental, decorations, and invitations, as well as ongoing costs like food and entertainment. Startup costs work the same way for your business. They fall into three major groups:

### One-Time Expenses
These are costs you incur just once during your launch:
- **Legal Formation Fees:** Costs for registering your business. *Example:* Incorporation fees or LLC formation.
- **Equipment Purchases:** Buying computers, machinery, or tools needed to operate.
- **Initial Inventory:** Stock of products youâ€™ll sell or use in production.
- **Website Development:** Costs for designing and building your online presence.
- **Security Deposits:** Payments required for leases or service agreements.
- **Licenses and Permits:** Government fees to legally operate in your industry.

### Recurring Costs
These are regular, ongoing expenses that you'll need to pay every month or year:
- **Rent/Lease Payments:** Cost of the space for your office or store.
- **Utilities:** Bills for electricity, water, internet, etc.
- **Insurance Premiums:** Regular payments for business insurance.
- **Employee Salaries:** Wages for staff members.
- **Marketing Expenses:** Regular costs for promoting your business.
- **Software Subscriptions:** Fees for essential online tools or services.

### Working Capital
This is your safety net for everyday operations:
- **Operating Expenses Buffer:** Extra cash to cover day-to-day costs.
- **Emergency Fund:** Money set aside for unexpected issues.
- **Seasonal Adjustments:** Additional funds to manage busy or slow periods.
- **Growth Capital:** Funds to invest in opportunities as your business scales.
