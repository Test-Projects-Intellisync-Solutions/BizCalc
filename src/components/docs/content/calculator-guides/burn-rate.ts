# Burn Rate Calculator Guide

Welcome to your ultimate guide to understanding **burn rate** â€” even if you have minimal business knowledge. We break down every term and number into plain language, with clear examples so you can see exactly how your money is being spent and how long it will last.

## TL;DR
**Burn rate** is the speed at which your business is spending cash. Knowing your burn rate helps you determine your "runway"â€”the number of months you have before your funds run outâ€”and guides you in making smarter financial decisions.

## Understanding Burn Rate

Imagine you have \$10,000 in your bank account. If you spend \$2,000 every month on bills, salaries, and other costs, your cash will run out in 5 months. That \$2,000 is your **burn rate**.

### Key Terms Explained

- **Gross Burn Rate:**  
  The total cash outflow per month.  
  *Example:* If your business spends \$2,000 a month on all expenses, thatâ€™s your gross burn rate.

- **Net Burn Rate:**  
  The monthly cash decrease after subtracting any revenue.  
  *Example:* If you have \$2,000 in expenses and generate \$500 in revenue, your net burn is \$1,500 per month.

- **Runway:**  
  The number of months you can continue operating before depleting your cash.  
  *Example:* With \$10,000 in the bank and a net burn rate of \$1,500, your runway is approximately 6.67 months.

- **Cash Efficiency:**  
  A measure of how much progress or revenue you generate per dollar spent.  
  *Example:* If every \$100 spent yields \$150 in progress or revenue, that indicates strong cash efficiency.
