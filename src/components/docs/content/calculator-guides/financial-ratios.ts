# Financial Ratios Guide

Welcome to the ultimate guide on Financial Ratiosâ€”a simple, friendly way to understand how well a business is doing, even if youâ€™ve never taken a business class. Think of these ratios as report cards that show the strengths and weaknesses of a company, explained in everyday language with clear examples.

## TL;DR
Financial ratios are formulas that compare numbers from a companyâ€™s financial statements to reveal its health, efficiency, and performance. By learning these, youâ€™ll be able to spot strengths, weaknesses, and opportunitiesâ€”even if youâ€™re new to business.

## What Are Financial Ratios?

Imagine youâ€™re checking your bank account. You want to know if you have enough money to pay your bills, if youâ€™re saving enough, and if you can handle unexpected expenses. Financial ratios do the same for a business by comparing key numbers to show its financial stability and performance.

## Types of Financial Ratios

### 1. Liquidity Ratios
These ratios tell you if a business can pay its short-term billsâ€”much like making sure you have enough cash in your wallet at the end of the month.

- **Current Ratio**  
  **Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities  
  **Target:** Greater than 2:1  
  **Example:** If a company has \$20,000 in assets (like cash, receivables, and inventory) and \$10,000 in bills due soon, the ratio is 2:1, meaning it should cover its immediate obligations.  
  **Purpose:** Indicates whether the company can meet short-term debts without selling long-term assets.

- **Quick Ratio**  
  **Formula:** (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities  
  **Target:** Greater than 1:1  
  **Example:** Suppose a business has \$20,000 in current assets but \$8,000 of that is inventory (which isnâ€™t as quickly converted to cash), and \$10,000 in liabilities. The quick ratio becomes (20,000 - 8,000) / 10,000 = 1.2, showing a reasonable cushion for immediate needs.  
  **Purpose:** Measures the ability to pay off short-term liabilities without relying on selling inventory.

- **Cash Ratio**  
  **Formula:** Cash / Current Liabilities  
  **Target:** Greater than 0.5:1  
  **Example:** If a company holds \$5,000 in cash and has \$10,000 in short-term obligations, the cash ratio is 0.5. This tells you that, in a pinch, the company might struggle to pay its bills solely with cash.  
  **Purpose:** Provides the most conservative measure of liquidity by considering only cash.

### 2. Profitability Ratios
These ratios show how good a company is at turning sales into profitâ€”like checking your report card to see how well you did in a test.

- **Gross Margin**  
  **Formula:** (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue  
  **Example:** If a business makes \$100,000 in sales and spends \$60,000 on production, the gross margin is (100,000 - 60,000) / 100,000 = 40%.  
  **Purpose:** Measures production efficiency and pricing strategy by revealing how much money is left after covering the cost to produce goods or services.

- **Operating Margin**  
  **Formula:** Operating Income / Revenue  
  **Example:** With \$100,000 in revenue and \$15,000 in operating income (the profit after operating expenses), the operating margin is 15%.  
  **Purpose:** Assesses how efficiently a business manages its day-to-day operations.

- **Net Margin**  
  **Formula:** Net Income / Revenue  
  **Example:** If after all expenses (including taxes and interest), a company earns \$10,000 on \$100,000 of revenue, its net margin is 10%.  
  **Purpose:** Provides an overall picture of profitability after all costs are considered.

### 3. Efficiency Ratios
These ratios measure how well a company uses its resources to generate sales, similar to getting the best bang for your buck.

- **Asset Turnover**  
  **Formula:** Revenue / Average Total Assets  
  **Example:** If a company earns \$200,000 in revenue and its average assets are \$100,000, its asset turnover is 2. This means every dollar invested in assets generates \$2 in revenue.  
  **Purpose:** Indicates how effectively a company uses its assets.

- **Inventory Turnover**  
  **Formula:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory  
  **Example:** A company with a COGS of \$50,000 and an average inventory of \$10,000 turns over its inventory 5 times a year.  
  **Purpose:** Evaluates how well inventory is managed by showing how many times itâ€™s sold and replaced in a period.

- **Receivables Turnover**  
  **Formula:** Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable  
  **Example:** If net credit sales are \$80,000 and average accounts receivable is \$20,000, the turnover is 4, meaning the company collects its receivables 4 times a year.  
  **Purpose:** Measures the efficiency of collecting payments from customers.

### 4. Leverage Ratios
These ratios show how much debt a company uses to finance its operations, similar to how much credit you use compared to your savings.

- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**  
  **Formula:** Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity  
  **Target:** Less than 2:1  
  **Example:** If a business has \$30,000 in debt and \$20,000 in equity, its ratio is 1.5, suggesting a balanced use of debt and ownersâ€™ funds.  
  **Purpose:** Reveals how much of the company is financed by debt versus the ownerâ€™s money.

- **Interest Coverage Ratio**  
  **Formula:** EBIT / Interest Expense  
  **Target:** Greater than 3:1  
  **Example:** With EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) of \$15,000 and interest expenses of \$3,000, the ratio is 5, meaning the company earns five times the amount needed to cover its interest expenses.  
  **Purpose:** Indicates how comfortably a company can pay interest on its debt.

### 3. Interpretation
- **Identify Strengths:**
