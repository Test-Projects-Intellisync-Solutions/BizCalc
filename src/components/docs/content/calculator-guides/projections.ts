## Understanding Projections

Imagine youâ€™re planning a big party. You need to predict how much money you'll receive (maybe through ticket sales or sponsorships) and how much you'll spend on food, decorations, and entertainment. In business, **revenue projections** estimate future income and **expense projections** estimate future spending. Together, they help you understand whether you'll have a surplus or a deficit.
