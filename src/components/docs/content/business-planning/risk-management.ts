## Risk Assessment Process

### 1. Risk Identification
Create a comprehensive list of potential risks, categorized by type.

| Category    | Risk             | Description                              |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|

| Financial   | Cash Flow Issue  | Major customer delays payment            |
| Compliance  | Regulation Change| New industry rules introduced            |

### 2. Risk Analysis
Evaluate each risk based on:
- **Likelihood:** How often might it occur?
- **Impact:** What is the potential damage or cost?
- **Detection:** How easy is it to identify early signs?
- **Onset Speed:** How quickly can it affect your business?

*Example Risk Rating Matrix:*
\`\`\`
Impact
│ High    ○ Monitor    ● Urgent     ● Critical
│ Medium  ○ Watch      ○ Monitor    ● Urgent
│ Low     ○ Accept     ○ Watch      ○ Monitor
└─────────┴───────────┴────────────┴──────────
          Low         Medium       High
                  Likelihood
\`\`\`

### 3. Risk Response Planning
Develop strategies for each significant risk using the following options:

#### Avoid
Change plans or processes to eliminate the risk.
*Example:* Choose a different location to avoid flood-prone areas in Chatham-Kent.

#### Reduce
Implement measures to lower the risk’s likelihood or impact.
*Example:* Schedule regular preventive maintenance on equipment to reduce breakdown risks.

#### Transfer
Shift the risk to a third party.
*Example:* Purchase insurance coverage to mitigate financial losses from unexpected events.

#### Accept
Acknowledge and monitor the risk when it’s minor or unavoidable.
*Example:* Accept normal seasonal fluctuations in sales while keeping an eye on trends.
