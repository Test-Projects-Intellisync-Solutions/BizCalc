This guide is designed for Canadian entrepreneurs and includes practical examples from Chatham-Kent, Ontario. By diving deep into market size, trends, customer demographics, and competitive dynamics, you’ll be well-equipped to make informed business decisions.

## Understanding Your Market

*Example:*
> "For a boutique fitness studio in Chatham-Kent:
> - TAM: 500,000 active adults across Ontario
> - SAM: 120,000 active adults in Southwestern Ontario
